# Devdr - An easy way to find collaborators for side projects.
Alex Chan, Hannah He, James Liao, and Dennis Yang 

Ever have a great tech idea but don't know how to go about making it?

Devdr provides the solution for technology driven communities with this dilemma. Our app helps you match up and find collaborators with similar interests and the skills you're looking for. Find a backend developer to complement your frontend skillset, or a designer to create sprites for the best-seller game you've built.

Our app uses an algorithm to find the best match for you based on your interests and preferences. Your highest preferences show up first, and you can choose whether you would like them on your team or not.
